# cookie-autoclicker
should work on this site: https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/
I made this because a course on Udemy had Selenium as a part of the course.
It works, the code is quite readable, so that's a good thing. ðŸ˜¸
It's very primitive and I could spend more time upragading it, but I don't realy want to :/ so I am going to leave it as it is.
